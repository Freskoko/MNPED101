The fairness is important
regardless of how well the powerpoint or teacher is, if only a few can understand it, no good

## What strategies would I pick?

I picked a strategy from each of the three types.

### Wait time

The first strategy i chose was "Wait time". I think asking questions to students is critical, but providing the answer right away, does not allow the student to attempt to answer questions themsleves.
From previous teaching experience, I know I can be "too kind", that meaning i answer student's questions too quickly. This article has really shown me the importance of allowing students to think.

### Student's names

The second strategy I selected was "Learn or have access to students name". An important part of running weekly group sessions is creating an environment where students feel welcomed, making them come back. A way to do that is to get the students names, making the group session feel more personable 

### Open ended questions

The third strategy I selected was "Ask openended questions". When asking questions to students, how you ask them is important. If I ask "why does this function return the wrong thing" I have then helped the student quite a bit and not allowed them to try to come up with the answer themselves. Instead a question like "why doesnt this function work" allows the student to try to bridge the gap in their own head what the issue was.
I feel like this strategy goes hand in hand with the first strategy, "wait time". An open ended question works very best by allowing wait time. I think it is also important to not judge responses, and letting the student know that they incorrect in a good way.
