# Teaching strategies summary

*Tanner 2013* is article which aims to provide teachers with a variety of teaching strategies, for a multitude of classroom situations. The article makes the point that regardless of how well structured a class is, it is important to see students not only as students, but induviduals who have different backgrounds. With this knoweledge, a teaching session can be organized in a "fairer" way. 
Students are all on different levels of knowledge and  willingsness to learn, so it is vital to diversify teaching methods to reach as many students as possible. Or as Tanner puts it: *“classroom equity” is about teaching all the students in your classroom, not just those who are already engaged, already participating, and perhaps already
know the biology being taught*

Through this article Tanner shows several main over-arching methods to increase learning efficacy. The first has to do with ecouraging indivusal thought. When students get to ponder what is being taught, they can begin to make connections, write detailed notes, and create questions they may want answered.

Question-answering is an important part of the second teaching method, which is all about getting all students to participate in a classroom environment. Strategies such as asking for multiple students to raise their hands, lowers barriers for entry when asking questions.

The third teahcing method pertains to inclusivity. The term is used broadly, firstly to describe how student's prefered learning methods may vary greatly, and it is therefore important to "mix it up". Like mentioned previosuly, students as induviduals may vary greatly, from cultures, backgrounds, age.. etc, and it is therefore important to consider this when teaching. For example, teaching politics and only giving examples from the western world, is throwing away many great oppurinties to draw connections from several politics arenas.

The fourth method is about considering behvaiour. As a teachr, one is seen as a role model, and students will notice if one "picks favuorites", or is overly critical. Being an objective teacher, one who does not critizise too hrashly, yet does not praise too much, is a tricky balance, but one that pays off very well.

The final method is about establishing what sort of a class one wil teach, and getting feedback on what students have learned. Tanner goes into detail on non-teaching moments, (disucssions about the class, time in breaks.. etc) is still forming the students view of the class. Daily student feedback to the teacher, can be an effective strategy to scope what students learn, and get feedback from quieter students who may not raise their hand so easily.


## What strategies would I pick?

### Wait time

The first strategy i chose was "Wait time". I think asking questions to students is critical, but providing the answer right away, does not allow the student to attempt to answer questions themselves.
From previous teaching experience, I know I can be "too kind", that meaning i answer student's questions too quickly. This article has really shown me the importance of allowing students to think.

### Student's names

The second strategy I selected was "Learn or have access to students name". An important part of running weekly group sessions is creating an environment where students feel welcomed, making them come back. A way to do that is to get the students names, making the group session feel more personable 

### Open ended questions

The third strategy I selected was "Ask openended questions". When asking questions to students, how you ask them is important. If I ask "why does this function return the wrong thing" I have then helped the student quite a bit and not allowed them to try to come up with the answer themselves. Instead a question like "why doesnt this function work" allows the student to try to bridge the gap in their own head what the issue was.
I feel like this strategy goes hand in hand with the first strategy, "wait time". An open ended question works very best by allowing wait time. I think it is also important to not judge responses, and letting the student know that they incorrect in a good way.
